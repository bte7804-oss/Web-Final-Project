# Web Development Final Project: Personal Portfolio
## Descrption: This project showcases my skills in basic web development using html, css and java script
## Features: Features in this personal portfolio include 3 distinct pages, namely, home, about me and a contact me page, all of which have their own basic/simple consistent styling and interactive layout.
## Technologies used: Used nothing but notepad and notepad only.
## Running the project couldn't be more simple, requires nothing but to open the one file in a browser and navigate through the rest using that file.
